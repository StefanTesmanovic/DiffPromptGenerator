Here is my concise code review:

**Readability:**

* Code is generally readable, with clear and concise naming conventions.
* Variable names are descriptive, making it easy to understand the code's purpose.
* HTML structure is clean and follows a consistent pattern.

**Complexity:**

* The code has a moderate level of complexity, mainly due to the use of JavaScript, DOM 
manipulation, and API calls.
* Some parts, like the API request handling, could be simplified or refactored for better 
maintainability.
* The overall complexity is manageable, but some sections might benefit from further 
abstraction or encapsulation.

**Differences:**

* Compared to previous versions, this code has improved readability due to:
	+ Consistent naming conventions and descriptive variable names.
	+ Clear and concise code structure.
* However, the complexity of the API request handling could be reduced by:
	+ Extracting the request logic into a separate function or class.
	+ Improving error handling and logging for better debugging.

**General Suggestions:**

* Consider extracting reusable functions or classes to improve maintainability and 
scalability.
* Review and refactor sections with high complexity, such as the API request 
handling.
* Use consistent naming conventions and descriptive variable names throughout the code.
